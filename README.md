# Hotel-Management-Program
Simple Java program to manage hotel booking 

SimpleJavaProgram: Hotel Booking System
Created by Nico Neiman 
as a preparation for the final project of 
COMIT FullStack Java developer course.
Winnipeg, Canada.
October 2019

Aims:

Practice how to apply a systematic object-oriented design process

Gained experience:
- Implement object-oriented program with multiple interacting classes
- Utilize FOR loops to manipulate different types of arrays. 
- Implement the appropriate libraries to manage date.
- Understand the use of modifiers, along with the use of instance and class methods.
- Learn more about the Java class libraries
- and more...



In this assignment, I implemented a prototype system that could serve as the "back-end" of a hotel reservation system. At this stage, it is intended to be used by Hotel personal and not by guests.
The goal operation is to create a new booking. For this to happen, it is necessary a Guest, a room, number of guests, the desired date and the number of nights.
A booking request is either granted in full or is completely rejected by the system (a request cannot be partially fulfilled).

- Users can execute the next operations:
- Create an Hotel and create bookings using its rooms.
- Create, edit, remove and find Rooms.
- Create a Guest directory
- Create, find, edit or erase  guests, keeping a sequential User Id number.
- Create, edit, find and cancel bookings.
- Find all valid bookings and/or all cancelled bookings.
- Find bookings by their unique Id or by the Guest's last name.
- Find users by the last name or by the Id number.
- Verify that room availability for desired dates.
- Keep track of Guest's booking history to create a reward program.
- And more...



Assessment will be based on the design of your program in addition to correctness. You should submit at least a UML class diagram used for the design of your program, i.e. not generated from code afterwards.
